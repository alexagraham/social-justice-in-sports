            <h3>The Goal of This Site</h3>
            <p>
              The goal of this site is to show how professional atheltes are
              using their image and popularity to support social justice reform.
              Amid a global pandemic, Racial injustice is at the forefront in
              the fight for a better America. Starting with the death of George
              Floyd, the tragic and unjust treatment of black people became just
              as large a fight as the pandemic itself. With racial tensions
              heightened and America hopefully turning a corner for the better,
              the fight only gets more attention and more support when some of
              the top athletes in the world show their support for the cause and
              that they are right there in it too.
            </p>

              Naomi Osaka, the 2020 U.S. Open Champion, brought seven different
              masks to New York. Each with a name printed on it of a black
              individual who lost their life unjustly. This was one of the
              biggest talks of the tournament and the fact that she got to play,
              and win, seven matches meant that the Black Lives Matter movement
              was supported seven times over, very publicly.

              Lebron James, arguably the greatest basketabll player of all time,
              wore different shirts through out his warm-ups during the NBA
              season. Each shirt had a different quote in support of the Black
              Lives Matter movement. He was one of the leading forces in the NBA
              to confront social unjust. Him, along with some teammates, knelt
              to the National Anthem while wearing Black Lives Matter shirts, to
              show their support for the lives unjustly lost.

              NFL players are not new to this movement, given that Colin
              Kaepernick has played a big role in the Black Lives Matter
              movement for years now. Except this time, there seemed to be a
              greater league wide support, as racial injustice is right in front
              of us. Many players across the league wore decals on their helmets
              with words of support and unity. Some of these helmets consisted
              of names of the lives lost unjustly. Others were words like
              "unity", or "Black Lives Matter".
