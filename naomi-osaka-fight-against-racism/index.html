            <h3>
              Naomi Osaka Brought 7 Face Coverings Total to the US Open — Each
              Honored a Black Life Lost
            </h3>
            <p>
              Naomi Osaka won the 2020 US Open women's singles final (sans the
              crowd) against Belarus's Victoria Azarenka 1-6, 6-3, 6-3 on Sept.
              12. This marked her second US Open singles title. Ahead of each
              round, she wore a face mask with the name of a different Black
              life lost at the hands of police brutality or other acts of racial
              violence. She had seven masks total — seven lives to be honored
              and stories to be told.
            </p>
            <p>
              "It's quite sad that seven masks isn't enough for the amount of
              names," Osaka said after her first-round victory, "so hopefully
              I'll get to the finals and you can see all of them." Well, she did
              exactly that.
            </p>
            <p>
              Her stand for racial justice at this year's US Open came after
              Osaka and other athletes across sports postponed their
              competitions at the end of August following the police shooting of
              29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, WI. She opted out of a
              semifinal match in the Western & Southern Open, writing on
              Twitter, "Before I am a athlete, I am a Black woman. And as a
              Black woman I feel as though there are much more important matters
              at hand that need immediate attention, rather than watching me
              play tennis." The tournament paused for a day before she won her
              semifinals match, but she withdrew before the final due to a
              hamstring injury.
