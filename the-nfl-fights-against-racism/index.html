            <h3>NFL Planning to Allow Social Justice Decals on Helmets</h3>
            <p>
              The NFL is planning to allow players to have decals on the back of
              their helmets bearing names of victims of systemic racism and
              police violence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The league has been in talks with individual players and their
              union since June about somehow honoring such victims. The
              initiative will be done league-wide, with each team deciding who
              it will honor and how to display the names.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unlike the NBA, which is allowing players to wear slogans on their
              jerseys, the NFL will stick to names once a final agreement has
              been reached with the playersâ€™ association. The program will
              continue for the entire season.
            </p>
            <p>
              This initiative is something of a breakthrough because the league
              has not allowed such messaging, except for during its October NFL
              Crucial Catch program in conjunction with the fight against breast
              cancer, and in its November salutes to the military. Players also
              have been allowed to represent a cause on their cleats one weekend
              per season.
            </p>
            <p>
              But a 17-week campaign such as the one being planned is something
              new for the NFL.
            </p>
            <p>
              A list of names for use on the helmet decals is being put together
              by the league and the NFLPA. Players have been encouraged to
              provide those names.
