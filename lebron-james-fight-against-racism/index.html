            <h3>
              LeBron James and Fellow NBA Players Kneel for National Anthem in
              Black Lives Matter Shirts as Season Returns
            </h3>
            <p>
              LeBron James, Anthony Davis and fellow NBA players kicked off the
              return of the season by showing their support for the Black Lives
              Matter movement during Thursday's games. The game between the Los
              Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers, held at The Arena at
              ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida,
              began with the players kneeling and wearing Black Lives Matter
              shirts as the Compton Kidz Club virtually performed the national
              anthem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Utah Jazz and the New Orleans Pelicans did the same thing ahead of
              their game, with Jon Batiste playing the national anthem.
            </p>
            <p>
              NBA commissioner Adam Silver expressed that he respects the
              "teams' unified act of peaceful protest for social justice and
              under these unique circumstances will not enforce our
              long-standing rule requiring standing during the playing of our
              national anthem."
            </p>
            <p>
              Some players also donned league-approved social justice messages
              on their jerseys where their names usually appear. Among the
              phrases were "Say Her Name," "Equality," "Listen to Us" and
              "Liberation."
            </p>
            <p>
              The NBA players are in a coronavirus "bubble," where teams are
              sequestered at Walt Disney World hotels for the remainder of the
              regular season games and upcoming playoffs to prevent the spread
              of the virus among players and their families. The athletes from
              22 of the 30 teams started quarantining in the Walt Disney World
              Resort nearly a month ago to prepare for their return.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ahead of the NBA restart, and as the players made their way onto
              the court, many couldn't help but notice James' fashionable
              accessory.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wearing a bluish-gray matching short-sleeve button-up shirt and
              shorts, the athlete was carrying a black mini purse.

              Meanwhile, the Detroit Pistons didn't make the cut to travel to
              Orlando for the modified second half of the NBA season. However,
              Pistons power forward Blake Griffin told ET earlier this week that
              he couldn't wait to see how the season played out.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I think guys are just excited to play basketball again, and I'm
              excited to watch," he expressed. "I'm trying not to pester these
              guys too much, because I'm sure everybody wants to know how the
              bubble is and is asking them the same questions, but [they're]
              also trying to concentrate on their season."
            </p>
            <p>
              As for other issues facing the restarted NBA season -- like a
              reignited conversation surrounding social justice initiatives and
              protests during the national anthem -- Griffin thinks the decision
              should be made internally.
            </p>
            <p>
              "I think however guys wanna express their support should be OK,"
              he noted. "I think one thing that basketball really did [well] --
              because we saw it happen with football first, and our season
              started a little later, back when this was sort of a bigger topic
              -- was teams wanted to do something together, and I think that's
              really powerful too."
